# Topic-Commitment

My idea for this assignment is probiotics. I would title it the "The Wonders of Probiotics" because so many people have no idea about probiotics but it is a very growing and becoming nutrition concept. In my blog I would make posts on what is probiotics, who needs probiotics, when to take probiotics, what kinds of probiotics there are, and an overview of everything for the basic of readers. People who could read this blog includes: healthy individuals, individuals with IBS, individuals with food allergies, and individuals who are constipated, bloated, or sick. This is a continuing blog because there are many new scientific studies being done on probiotics and the benefits and need for them. I would not struggle with coming up with new blogs on a constant basis.
